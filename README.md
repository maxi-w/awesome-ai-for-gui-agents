### UI understanding datasets for UIBert
https://github.com/google-research-datasets/uibert

Two datasets that are extended from the public Rico dataset, which contains 72k mobile app UI data. They add two different types of annotations to these UIs.


1. In AppSim, each datapoint contains two UIs of similar category and the annotation of two semantically similar UI elements on them, such as a “Menu” buttons that appear on two UIs.
2. In RefExp, each datapoint contains a UI and a referring expression of a UI element on it, such as “Red button on the top”.
